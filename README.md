This is a take-home test project for employment.
It is a filter menu app built in React.
I had a problem rendering nested arrays.
It is incomplete because I ran out of time that was available to me. I had most of it rendered, I was wanting to bring in a drop-down drawer and finish the logic for the active buttons.
Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed myself.
